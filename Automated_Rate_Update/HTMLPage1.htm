<span class="pageTitle"> COBRA Insurance Premium Renewal Updates - Introduction</span><br />
<span class="textFont">Use this application to manger your group insurance plans subject to COBRA or Mini-COBRA. You can remove existing plans, update existing plans and add new plans, as described below.</span><br /><br />

<span class="dataSetctionTitle">Important – New Rating Methodologies Due to Health Care Reform</span><br />
<span class="textFont">Healthcare reform is having significant impacts on group medical plan rating methodologies. What has been decades of family tier pricing (e.g., Single, Employee + 1, Employee + Family, etc). are changing for many groups.<br /><br />

We have updated this application to accommodate all of the different new rating methodologies we have learned about.</span><br /><br />

<span class="dataSetctionTitle">How to change existing Medical Plans Methodologies</span><br />
<span class="dataSubSetctionTitle">Current Medical Plans</span><br />
<span class="textFont">On the next page we list your current medical plans. You will have the option to keep them and their associated rating schemes (e.g., Employee Only, Employee/Child, Employee & Family, etc.), or redefine those plans with different rating schemes.</span><br /><br />

<span class="dataSetctionTitle">Changing a Current Plan’s Rating Methodology</span><br />
<span class="textFont">If you have a plan that you will be keeping but need to change its rating methodology, you will need to Remove the plan using the Remove button provided on the next page, and use the Add Another Plan button to setup the plan again but with the new rating methodology.<br /><br />

Unfortunately, due to historical and current-to-Plan-Year-End reasons, we cannot allow you to modify an existing plan with a new rating methodology. Thus, to assign a new rating methodology to an existing plan you will need to: (1) Remove the existing plan and (2) Add Another Plan and associate it with the new rating methodology. All of this is explained on the next page listing your current plans.</span><br /><br />

<span class="dataSetctionTitle">Adding New Plans</span><br />
<span class="textFont">If you need to add one or more new medical plans, you will simply click the Add Another Plan button and follow the on screen instructions. </span><br /><br />


<span class="dataSetctionTitle">These Instructions…. Always Available</span><br />
<span class="textFont">Don’t worry! When you go to the next page to update your plan information, you will be able to access these and additional instructions from the Help button in the upper right corner of the next page. </span><br /><br />
